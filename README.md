# Project-Luke
This repository contains some of my Machine learning projects I have done, and doing as a developer/student.
This project has been started recently so there are not much to explore. In some projects you can see I have used external API's
and all and some have been completly done by me with use of python libraries. More projects are yet to come, feel free to fork it contribuit 
and make changes or clone it and play around with it.
