# Turing Checker Machine

A Streamlit application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to check the accuracy of your code. The application supports several programming languages such as Python, C, C++, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Java. You can choose your language of choice, write your code, and provide test cases to verify the accuracy of your code.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- streamlit
- langchain

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ajayspatil7/Project-Luke.git`
2. Change the directory: `cd turing-checker-machine`
3. Install the required libraries: 
   - `pip install streamlit`
   - `pip install langchain`
4. os comes inbuilt in python and interfaceBuilder comes with the repo so no need to install manually
5. Run the application: `streamlit run mainApp.py`

## Usage

1. Select the programming language you want to write your code in.
2. Write your code in the text area provided. Or Paste the copied code
3. Choose to test your code with or without test cases.
4. If you choose to test your code with test cases, provide them in the text area provided.
5. Click the "Submit your code" button to check the accuracy of your code.
6. The application will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to analyze your code and provide feedback on how many test cases your code passed or failed.
